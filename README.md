# Huffman-Coding
This is project designed for my Algorithms and Data Structures course, written in C++ language. 
The program creates the Huffman tree which encodes a given weighted alphabet. The project uses binary trees and heaps, 
implemented by lists, and itâ€™s purpose is to send encoded messages, which can only be translated by those who know the letters 
used in the alphabet as well as their weight.
You can change the letters of the alphabet and their weight in "file.in" (the first number is the number of letters), and try to
encode and decode words as you please:)
